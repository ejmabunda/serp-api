# SERP API for Search Engine Results

## API: [SERP API] https://serpapi.com/

### Description:

Develop an application that fetches search engine results for queries as entered by users, enabling them to analyze and gather information about common search results, including local, organic, and paid listings. The application will  organize and display the results in a user-friendly manner, offering insights into search trends and search history.

## Key Features:

- Input search queries and retrieve data about results.
- Analyze types of results (organic, ads and so on).
- Display data in an organized format, including links, snippets, and other relevant information.
- Allow the users to click and visit the links from the search results directly.


## Iterations:

### Iteration 1: Basic Search Functionality

- Accept a user-provided search query and connect to the SERP API successfully.
- Retrieve and display the raw JSON data for the search results.
- Implement error handling for common query issues like an empty input, or connection errors. 


### Iteration 2: Structured Result Display

- Format the JSON results to display an organized list of search results including titles, snippets, and URLs.
- Introduce pagination if there are multiple search result pages. (Let's set the page limit to 3)
- Implement a simple UI that allows users to click on the links to open them.


### Iteration 3: Trend Analysis and Query Saving

- Allow users to save previous search queries and display them for easy access.
- Implement trend analysis features to show repeated queries and common search topics.(maybe set a counter to determine this)
- Enhance the user interface to clearly categorize search results and search history.
